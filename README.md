# Introduction
Quant is an auto-trading and sniping platform built using the Rust language. It is capable of sniping a token at the very first block itself. 

Note: **This is a scrubbed version of my private repo, meaning: there will be no git history**.

### Be warned!
 - Stay within your spending limits, sniping a token is a very risky gamble. Remember, don't invest more than what you could afford to lose
 - DYOR, Don't invest your money into Honeypots. You know how it goes
 - Always start with a smaller amount

### Features
- Snipe at the very first block itself
- Separate flows for Buying, Selling and Buy & Dump
- CLI to choose between the trading modes
- Time limits
- Time delays
- Auto approve the token
- Auto trade after a time
- Auto trade after a value
- Stop trade after a time limit
- Stop trade after a percentage of value increase

- Insert in a token at the T0th second of the IDO, via CLI
